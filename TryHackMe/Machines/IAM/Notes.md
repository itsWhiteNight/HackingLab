Have you ever thought about any of the following questions?

How can we uniquely identify the different system users?
How can a user prove who they are to the system?
How can we help prevent an attacker from pretending to be a legitimate user?
How can we decide what a user should access? How can we enforce such a decision?
How can we know what a user is doing after logging in so that we can hold them accountable for their actions?
In this room, we answer the above questions and others using formal technical terms. If you are curious, the answers to the questions above lie in the following concepts and processes:

Identification
Authentication
Strong passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Authorisation and Access Control
Logging and Auditing


This room introduces the reader to key concepts related to managing identities and authorisations. It starts with identification and authentication and proceeds to accountability before it concludes with access control models.
