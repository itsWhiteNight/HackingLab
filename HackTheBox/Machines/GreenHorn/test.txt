Hello junior,

We have recently installed OpenVAS on our server to actively monitor and identify potential security
vulnerabilities. Currently, only the root user, represented by myself, has the authorization to execute
OpenVAS using the following command:

`sudo /usr/sbin/openvas`
Enter password:
As part of your familiarization with this tool, we encourage you to learn how to use OpenVAS
effectively. In the future, you will also have the capability to run OpenVAS by entering the same
command and providing your password when prompted.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Have a great week,
Mr. Green
