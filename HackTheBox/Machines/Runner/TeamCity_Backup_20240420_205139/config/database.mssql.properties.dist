# This is a sample file for configuring TeamCity to use an external database.
# To make it effective, copy it to the "database.properties" file and modify the settings
# according to your environment.
# Do not modify this file, it will be overwritten on the TeamCity server start-up.
# See documentation at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/?Setting+up+an+External+Database

# Database: Microsoft SQL server (via native driver)
connectionUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://<hostname>:1433;databaseName=<dbname>

# If you use a named instance, specify the instance name in the connection URL:
# connectionUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://<host>\\<instance_name>:1433;databaseName=<database_name>


connectionProperties.user=<username>
connectionProperties.password=<password>
# Note: the two properties above are *not* used in case of Integrated Authentication.


# If you prefer to use MS SQL integrated security (Windows authentication), see the documentation at 
# https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/setting-up-teamcity-with-ms-sql-server.html#Additional+settings+for+Windows+authentication+%28MS+SQL+integrated+security%29
# The connection URL to use MS SQL integrated security: 
# connectionUrl=jdbc:sqlserver://<host>:1433;databaseName=<database name>;integratedSecurity=true
# Note: No user names or passwords should be specified.

# The maximum number of connections TeamCity can open on the database server.
maxConnections=50

# Specifies whether TeamCity should check each jdbc connection before use.
# It reduces the system performance but avoids cases when the system uses
# a connection that was closed by the database server due to a time-out or this
# connection was broken during the previous operation.
testOnBorrow=true
