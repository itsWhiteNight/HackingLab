Malware Samples :

		VirusShare: An excellent resource for malware researchers, VirusShare houses a vast collection of malware samples. They currently have over 30 million samples in their repository, all of which are freely available to the public.
		
		
		Hybrid Analysis: This website allows us to submit files for malware analysis. However, they also have a public feed of their analyses, where malware samples are often shared.
		
		
		TheZoo: A GitHub repository that contains a collection of live malware for analysis and education. The repository also contains additional information about each sample, such as its family and the type of activities it performs.
		
		
		Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net: This website provides traffic analysis exercises that can be extremely beneficial for people trying to learn about malware traffic patterns. They often provide pcap files of actual malware traffic, which can be quite informative.
		
		
		VirusTotal: VirusTotal inspects items with over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services, in addition to a myriad of tools to extract signals from the studied content. Any user can select a file from their computer using their browser and send it to VirusTotal. VirusTotal offers a number of file submission methods, including the primary public web interface, desktop uploaders, browser extensions and a programmatic API.
		
		
		ANY.RUN: An interactive online sandbox for malware analysis. The service allows researchers to analyze malware behavior by running samples in a controlled environment. While it offers both free and paid tiers, even the free version provides access to public submissions, which can include various malware samples.
		
		
		Contagio Malware Dump: Contagio Dump is a collection of malware samples, threat reports, and related resources curated by a malware researcher named Mila. The site provides direct, anonymized access to an extensive range of malware samples, including various types of trojans, worms, ransomware, and exploits. It's frequently used by security researchers and analysts to study malware behavior and develop mitigation techniques.
		
		
		VX Underground: VX-Underground is one of the largest collections of malware source code, articles, and papers on the internet. It aims to collect, preserve, and share all kinds of materials related to malware, exploit, and hacking culture. This resource is valuable to security researchers and enthusiasts who want to study malware construction and behavior from a more technical and code-centric perspective.
		
## Disk Imaging Solutions


		FTK Imager: Developed by AccessData (now acquired by Exterro), FTK Imager is one of the most widely used disk imaging tools in the cybersecurity field. It allows us to create perfect copies (or images) of computer disks for analysis, preserving the integrity of the evidence. It also lets us view and analyze the contents of data storage devices without altering the data.
		
		
		OSFClone: A free, open-source utility designed for the task of creating and cloning forensic disk images. It's easy to use and supports a wide variety of file systems.
		
		
		DD and DCFLDD: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS). DD is a versatile tool included in most Unix-based systems by default, while DCFLDD is an enhanced version of DD with features specifically useful for forensics, such as hashing.
		
## Memory Acquisition Solutions

		DumpIt: A simplistic utility that generates a physical memory dump of Windows and Linux machines. On Windows, it concatenates 32-bit and 64-bit system physical memory into a single output file, making it extremely easy to use.

		MemDump: MemDump is a free, straightforward command-line utility that enables us to capture the contents of a system's RAM. Itâ€™s quite beneficial in forensics investigations or when analyzing a system for malicious activity. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for memory acquisition.

		Belkasoft RAM Capturer: This is another powerful tool we can use for memory acquisition, provided free of charge by Belkasoft. It can capture the RAM of a running Windows computer, even if there's active anti-debugging or anti-dumping protection. This makes it a highly effective tool for extracting as much data as possible during a live forensics investigation.

		Magnet RAM Capture: Developed by Magnet Forensics, this tool provides a free and simple way to capture the volatile memory of a system.

		LiME (Linux Memory Extractor): LiME is a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows the acquisition of volatile memory. LiME is unique in that it's designed to be transparent to the target system, evading many common anti-forensic measures.
