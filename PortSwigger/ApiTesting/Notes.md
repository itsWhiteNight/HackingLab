#### API recon

you first need to find out as much information about the API as possible, to discover its attack surface.

To begin, you should identify API endpoints. These are locations where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server. For example, consider the following GET request:

GET /api/books HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
The API endpoint for this request is /api/books. This results in an interaction with the API to retrieve a list of books from a library. Another API endpoint might be, for example, /api/books/mystery, which would retrieve a list of mystery books.

Once you have identified the endpoints, you need to determine how to interact with them. This enables you to construct valid HTTP requests to test the API. For example, you should find out information about the following:

The input data the API processes, including both compulsory and optional parameters.
The types of requests the API accepts, including supported HTTP methods and media formats.
Rate limits and authentication mechanisms.


#### API documentation

APIs are usually documented so that developers know how to use and integrate with them.

Documentation can be in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. Human-readable documentation is designed for developers to understand how to use the API. It may include detailed explanations, examples, and usage scenarios. Machine-readable documentation is designed to be processed by software for automating tasks like API integration and validation. It's written in structured formats like JSON or XML.

API documentation is often publicly available, particularly if the API is intended for use by external developers. If this is the case, always start your recon by reviewing the documentation.

#### Using machine-readable documentation

You can use a range of automated tools to analyze any machine-readable API documentation that you find.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl and audit OpenAPI documentation, or any other documentation in JSON or YAML format. You can also parse OpenAPI documentation using the OpenAPI Parser BApp.

You may also be able to use a specialized tool to test the documented endpoints, such as Postman or SoapUI.

#### Identifying API endpoints

You can also gather a lot of information by browsing applications that use the API. This is often worth doing even if you have access to API documentation, as sometimes documentation may be inaccurate or out of date.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.

While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as /api/. Also look out for JavaScript files. These can contain references to API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browser. Burp Scanner automatically extracts some endpoints during crawls, but for a more heavyweight extraction, use the JS Link Finder BApp. You can also manually review JavaScript files in Burp.
